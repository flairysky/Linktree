    <p>Hi!</p>

    <p>
      This is a personal webpage of a student with interests in the following topics ‚Äî in no particular order ‚Äî non-fiction books, startups, poetry, basketball and sports in general, languages and linguistics, math and other STEM subjects like biology, physics, engineering, and space exploration. 
      Oh, comedy movies, music and 1gegen100 too!
    </p>

    <p>
      Further, I read math books for fun and find it much more enjoyable when shared with someone else.
      If you‚Äôd like to try reading one together, feel free to text me. (btw no prerequisites are required and it is not necessary at all to be a math student).
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, I am curious about all kinds of entrepreneurial ventures, which make sense üòÅ
    </p>

    <p>
      Since, like meeting interesting people, if you are in Zurich and any of the above sounds like it could lead to a cool conversation, or if you think it could just be fun to meet to discuss potential startup ideas, read math books together or if you have some music recommendation, drop me a line. I‚Äôd be happy to grab a coffee. ‚úåüèª
    </p>

    <p>
      Hope you have a nice day! üòÉ
    </p>
